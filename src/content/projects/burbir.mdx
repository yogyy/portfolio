## Short Explanation

This project is a small-scale social media platform that aims to resemble Twitter in terms of functionality and design. It provides users with a platform to express their thoughts, share updates, and engage in conversations with other users. The main goal is to create a simplified version of Twitter with limited features.

My project is a social media built using NextJs. Some of the features that have been implemented include:

- 🔒 User Registration and Authentication.

- ✉️ Posting Tweets.

- 👤 User Profiles.

- ❤️ Like and Comment on Tweets.

However, there are still some features that I plan to add in the future:

- 👥 Follow Functionality

## Project Goals

The project aims to replicate essential features of Twitter, including posting tweets, following/unfollowing users, liking tweets, commenting on tweets, and displaying personalized feeds. The platform should closely emulate the user experience of Twitter, providing a familiar environment for users.
